# babel_webpack_starter

This starter project is pre-built with Babel and Webpack as well as webpack server so that all changes in all js files are automatically compiled down to the build file.

To use this starter, clone the repo and remove everything from the app.js and lib.js files which are filled with some example code, and clean out the html file as desired.
